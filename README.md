# beamline_simulation
Simulation of the beamline using elegant

## TODO
* Relation of current into sim -> build in zero quadrupoles from log book
* Instruction to install elegant and how to use simulation
* CAT values from Dennis Sauerland into Sim
* better optimization function
* A2 to extraction point in sim
